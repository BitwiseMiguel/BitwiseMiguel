# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me
Hello! My name is Miguel. I am a passionate developer with a strong interest in technology and mathematics. I have a background in Mathematics and have been applying my knowledge to projects related to game development and data analysis.

## Goals and Motivations
My main motivation is to solve complex challenges by abstracting the problem and focusing on the most relevant data. I strive to find innovative solutions to real-world problems. I am fascinated by the intersection of mathematics and technology, and I am always seeking new projects that allow me to explore this connection.

## Skills and Experience
I have experience in several programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and C++. My data analysis skills allow me to extract valuable insights from complex datasets.

## Featured Projects
Here are some recently worked on projects that I would like to highlight:

1. **Sensible Car**: I developed algorithms used in autonomous vehicles for material recognition and traffic sign detection.

2. **Casino Game Analysis**: Leveraging my knowledge in various areas of Mathematics, I contributed to the reverse engineering analysis of casino games and the creation of new competitive models for these games.

## Collaboration and Open Source Interest
I am always open to collaborating on open source projects. I believe that collaboration is essential for the growth of the software development community. If you have an interesting project and are looking for collaborators, please don't hesitate to contact me!
